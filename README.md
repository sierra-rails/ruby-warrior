# Ruby Warrior @ Sierra Rails

## How to use this

1. clone this repository into a folder on your computer and `cd` into it (may require you to install new ruby 3.0.1)
2. Run `bundle install --binstubs`
3. Run `bundle exec rubywarrior` and follow the instructions

Note: When you see instructions that say "run rubywarrior", you should instead run `bin/rubywarrior`. This is because running the `rubywarrior` command from the root directory when using zsh will just `cd` you into that directory.
